                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is  
                    used to design the web pages. With the help of HTML,  
                    you can create a complete website structure. HTML  
                    is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. 
                    Hypertext defines the link between the web pages  
                    and markup language defines the text document within  
                    the tag that define the structure of web pages.

                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to styles web  
                    pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred  
                    to as CSS. The reason for using this is to simplify  
                    the process of making web pages presentable. It allows  
                    you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly,  
                    it enables you to do this independently of the HTML  
                    that makes up each web page.
